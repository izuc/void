# Void Development Setup

Welcome to Void! This guide explains how to set up Void for development, including installing dependencies, building React components, compiling, and running the app. It also includes troubleshooting steps, requirements like Visual Studio tools, and a typical development workflow.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**:
   - Recommended version: **v20**.
   - Install via [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/) or `nvm`:
     ```bash
     nvm install 20
     nvm use 20
     ```

2. **Git**:
   - Ensure Git is installed and configured:
     ```bash
     git --version
     ```

3. **Python**:
   - Required for some build tools.
   - Install Python 3.x and ensure itâ€™s in your `PATH`.

4. **Visual Studio 2022**:
   - Install the **Community Edition** from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
   - During installation, select the following workloads and components:
     - **Desktop Development with C++**
     - **C++ Build Tools**
     - **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 Build Tools**
     - **Windows 10 SDK**
     - **Spectre-mitigated Libraries**
   - Ensure `cl.exe` and related tools are accessible in your terminal.

5. **VSCode Locally Cloned**:
   - Clone the Void repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/voideditor/void.git
     cd void
     ```

6. **Forking** (Optional):
   - Fork the repository on GitHub and update the remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add myfork https://github.com/<your-username>/void.git
     ```

## Setting Up Void

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following to install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

---

### 2. Build React Components
Void uses React for some parts of its UI. Build the React components:
```bash
npm run buildreact
```

If youâ€™re actively developing React components, you can use the watch mode:
```bash
npm run watchreact
```

---

### 3. Compile the Project
After building React components, compile the rest of the project:
```bash
npm run compile
```

---

### 4. Running Void

#### Using `.bat` Files
Void can be launched using the provided `.bat` file:
```bash
.\scripts\code.bat
```

#### Directly via Electron
Alternatively, you can run Void with Electron:
```bash
electron ./out/main.js
```

> **Note:** Running with Electron directly may result in missing environment variables. The `.bat` file ensures proper setup.

---

## Development Workflow

1. Build React components:
   ```bash
   npm run buildreact
   ```
2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```
3. Launch Void:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\code.bat
   ```

---

## Debugging Electron

To debug the Electron app:
1. Run Electron in debug mode:
   ```bash
   electron --inspect ./out/main.js
   ```
2. Open `chrome://inspect` in your browser.
3. Select your Electron instance to view logs and debug.

---

## Dependencies Overview

Void relies on the following key technologies:
- **React**: For building the UI.
- **Electron**: For the desktop application environment.
- **VS Code API**: To extend and integrate functionality from the Visual Studio Code platform.

---

## Common Issues

### Missing `nls.messages.json`
If the app shows an empty screen, it may be due to a missing localization file:
1. Ensure the file exists:
   ```
   D:\void\out\nls.messages.json
   ```
2. If missing, create a placeholder file:
   ```json
   {}
   ```

### GitHub API Rate Limits
If you encounter rate limits while updating grammars:
1. Generate a **GitHub Personal Access Token**.
2. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

### Visual Studio Errors
If builds fail, ensure:
- The **Desktop Development with C++** workload is installed.
- **MSVC v143** and **Windows 10 SDK** are installed.

## Contributing

1. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your message"
   ```

2. Push changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push myfork main
   ```

3. Open a Pull Request to the original repository.

---

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

1. Fetch updates from the original repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Merge changes:
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push myfork main
   ```
